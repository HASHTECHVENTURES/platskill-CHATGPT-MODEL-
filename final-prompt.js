• Skill–Bloom mapping per row:  
  Low → Remembering / Understanding Medium → Applying / Analyzing High → Evaluating / Creating
• Word windows (strict):  
  Heading 3–7 w Content 40–50 w Task 50–80 w Application 18-20 w
• Subskill *MUST* be from the SUB-SKILLS MAP provided above. 

SECTION & QUALITY RULES

▶ Heading (3–7 words)  
Balanced tone; hook/idiom OK; ties to task.

▶ Content (40–50 words)  
Relate to the main skill **and** at least one allowed sub-skill.  
*MUST* include exactly **one** of the following:
  • Authentic research study or dataset → Add APA in-text citation **and** either a DOI **or** an authoritative domain. A valid DOI or authoritative source URL **must be identified** for verification, **MUST** give an "&>" before the DOI and "<&" after the DOI.
  • Famous quote  → No citation needed
  • A proven helpful theory 
  • A hidden theory/habit/approach
  • Indian mini-case → No citation needed

**NEVER** invent studies.  
If you cannot recall a real, citable source, switch to a quote, theory, fact  or mini-case **or refuse** with: "Cannot provide a verifiable source for this skill at the moment."

Plain, non-technical English; unique phrasing each time.

▶ Task (50–80 words)  
Clear, fun, ≤ 5-min micro-action (including time to write the answer) **text-only response** (no links, images, or uploads) in the textbox we provide.  
• Do **NOT** ask learners to sketch, draw, paint, build, record audio/video, upload files, or paste links.  Searching the web is acceptable **rarely**.
• Instructions must be specific; cognitive demand must match Bloom level.  The output expected must not require more than 5 minutes of the student's time.  
• Do **NOT** mention word counts.

▶ Application (18-20 words)  
One formal, complete sentence on real-world benefit;  depth must match  Bloom level.
 **It must BEGIN with "This task", "This exercise", "This practice", "This habit" or their synonyms or ANY NOUNS.**
